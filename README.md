# 🚲 Rapido Ride Analytics – Operations & Business Insights

An end-to-end **Data Analytics project** focused on understanding ride-hailing operations using **SQL, Power BI, and Excel/CSV data**.  
This project analyzes booking patterns, cancellations, vehicle performance, payments, and ratings to derive actionable business insights.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Ride-hailing platforms like Rapido operate at scale and face challenges such as:
- ride cancellations  
- operational inefficiencies  
- uneven vehicle performance  
- payment preference management  

This project aims to **analyze ride-level operational data** and convert raw data into **meaningful insights** that can support better decision-making.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem

The key business questions addressed in this project are:

- What percentage of rides are successfully completed?
- Which vehicle types face higher cancellation rates?
- What are the major reasons behind incomplete rides?
- Which payment methods are most preferred by customers?
- How does driver and customer rating impact ride completion?
- Who are the high-frequency customers on the platform?

---

## 🧠 Approach & Solution

To solve the above problems, I followed a structured **end-to-end analytics workflow**:

### 🔍 1. Data Understanding & Exploration
- Explored the dataset to understand ride-level attributes
- Identified key columns related to bookings, ratings, distance, value, and cancellations

### 🧹 2. Data Cleaning
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Ensured correct data types for numerical and categorical fields
- Prepared the dataset for analysis and querying

### 🗄️ 3. SQL-Based Analysis
- Created multiple **SQL views** to validate core business KPIs such as:
  - Completion rate
  - Cancellation rate by vehicle type
  - Payment method share
  - Driver rating segmentation
- Used `CASE WHEN`, aggregations, and grouping for business logic

### 📊 4. Power BI Dashboarding
- Built interactive dashboards to visualize:
  - Booking status distribution
  - Vehicle-wise performance
  - Revenue and payment trends
  - Cancellation patterns
  - Rating analysis
- Enabled filters for better exploration and insights

### 📈 5. Insight Generation
- Translated analytical results into operational and business insights
- Highlighted patterns that can help improve platform efficiency
